Django is an extremely popular and fully featured server-side web framework, written in Python. 
The framework itself has very much detailed and properly arranged documentation. It also has its own tutorial series which will help new users learn basics of Django by doing small projects.


Building websites in Django is very fast. Once you know the basics, you can launch a website from scratch overnight. 
It provides very much wide functionality and flexibility than cms like Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla. And it is much easier and faster to learn than php, Ruby etc.

If you are thinking of making websites that would scale then, the website you just asked your question was itself built on django and it has scaled pretty nice. There are other websites that are built on django as well. There is a good number of people or organisations looking for django developers.

Reasons why you should chose Django:

You need to develop a web app or API backend.
You need to move fast, deploy fast, and also make changes as you move ahead.
The app must be secure from most common vulnerabilities and attacks by default. For example CSRF, SQL Injection, XSS, Clickjacking, etc.
Your app might scale up/down at any point of time.
You might integrate cutting edge tech in future, eg. Machine Learning.
You need to use a reliable framework which is actively developed, and used by many top websites and companies on the planet.
You need both web app and API backend in same codebase to comply with “Single source of truth” (aka DRY)
You don’t want to work with database queries directly, and need ORM support.
You want to use open source software.
You’re concerned about finding solutions if you get stuck, so a good documentation and supportive community should be present.

Taking a decision on IT-technologies, we are also trying to find a balance between the costs of maintaining technology (including search and training of new staff) and the functionality that is being acquired.

Django framework, of course, brings some trouble, but at the same time it allows you to solve a huge range of tasks quickly and easily find the developers. In other words, Django framework makes software development by Python cheaper. With a competent approach, you can use all the advantages of Django and not become a hostage of its shortcomings.
