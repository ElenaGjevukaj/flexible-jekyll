**WHAT IS GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE?**

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development.
Undergrads, students in graduate programs, PhD candidates can take part in GSoC.

Due to the prestigiousness of the program and the weight of Googleâ€™s name to go with it, acceptance into the program is no easy task.
GSoC is based on the model of different organizations providing projects for students all around the world. Each organization assign mentors for every project and students are paired up with mentors once they get selected.

**Why open source ?**
Open source software is the heart and soul of many organizations. It would be real hard to imagine more secure and reliable software without open source initiatives. Everyday hundreds and thousands of developers contribute to different open source software.

**My Project for GSOC 2018**
My project was Wizard/GUI https://salsa.debian.org/new-contributor-wizard-team/new-contributor-wizard helping students/interns apply and get started and the final application is named New Contributor Wizard. It originated as the brainchild and Project Idea of my mentor Daniel Pocock for GSoC 2018 under Debian. 
New Contributor Wizard is a GUI application build to help new contributors get started with Open Source. It was an idea to bring together all the Tools and Tutorials necessary for a person to learn and start contributing to Open Source. 
The application contains different courseware sections like Communication, Version Control System etc. and within each section, there are respective Tools and Tutorials.

The last evaluation phase had been reached and it marked the end of this great experience. I succesfully finished Google Summer of Code! The learning experience in large-scale open source projects is truly unparalleled. Not only do you improve your coding skills but also nail a whole bunch of other technical skills and ways to communicate with people scattered in different time-zones around the world without once meeting in person.

Now our project [New Contributor Wizard](https://salsa.debian.org/new-contributor-wizard-team/new-contributor-wizard) is ready for the users who would like to get started with Open Source as well as to the folks who would like to contribute Tools and Tutorials to the application as well.
I'am definitely planning to come back and contribute more to this project and in open soruce community.
