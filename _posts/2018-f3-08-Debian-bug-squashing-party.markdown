Bug Squashing Party was organized by Debian and OpenLabs in Tirana last weekend (3,4 March 2018). BSP is a come-together of Debian Developers and Debian enthusiasts on a specified timeframe where these persons try to fix as many bugs as possible.

A large number of Kosovo participants took place, mostly female students. 
Me and my group chosed to focus on adding Kosovo to country-lists in Debian by verifying that Kosovo was missing and then filing bug reports or, even better, doing pull requests.

Below you will find some of the photos from this awesome event. Let's hope we will get together soon!
