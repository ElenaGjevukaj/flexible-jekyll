DebConf18 took place in Hsinchu, Taiwan, from July 29th to August 5th, 2018. It was the first Debian Annual Conference in Asia, with over 300 attendees.

[DebConf](https://www.debconf.org) is the Debian Project's developer conference. In addition to a full schedule of technical, social and policy talks, DebConf provides an opportunity for developers, contributors and other interested people to meet in person and work together more closely.It has taken place annually since 2000 in locations as varied as Canada, Finland and Mexico. 

I was doing the Google Summer of Code Internship with Debian and I was fortunate enough to attend this conference and visit the beautiful city of Hsinchu. Being one of the three GSoC Interns from Kosovo, I had the chance to meet and work with great developers and to give a talk about my project.
