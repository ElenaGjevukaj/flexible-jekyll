CoderGals Hackathon was organized for the first time in my country. This event took place in the beautiful city of Prizren. 
This hackathon held for 24 to 48 hours, was an idea which started from two girls majoring in Computer Science, Qendresa and Albiona Hoti. 

Thanks to them, we had the chance to work on exciting projects as well as be mentored by key tech people including: Mergim Cahani, Daniel Pocock, Taulant Mehmeti, Mergim Krasniqi, Kolos Pukaj, Bujar Dervishaj, Arta Shehu Zaimi and Edon Bajrami.

We brainstormed for about 3-4 hours to decide for the project. We discussed many ideas that ranged from Doppler effect to GUI interfaces for phone calls. Finally we ended up making an project for linking the PC with your phone so it will ease the procedure not to use both when you need to add a contact, make a call or even sent text messages.
We called it Phone Client project.

It was a challenge for us because we worked for the first time on Debian OS.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
